# 📖 Description<br>
A simple and minimal app to keep you focused. The main feature is the intentionally annoying window that always stays on top of what you're currently doing, not letting you get sidetracked. It doesn't try to be something else, just a simple reminder that you can't move on to the next thing until this gets done.

# 🚀 Installation & Deployment<br>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukakosanovicc/FocusPro.git
```
```bash
cd FocusPro
```
```bash
?
```
```bash
python3 main.py
```

# 📝 Data Format<br>
tasks.txt -> a file to store current tasks that need to be done<br>
done.txt -> a file to store completed tasks<br>

- The tasks are intentionally stored in text files rather than binary, for easier manipulation outside of the application (sacrifising some speed for ease of use)

## 👉 Accessing the files
- tasks.txt is accessed within the application, but both files can also be found in `Documents > FocusPro` on Windows, and on MacOS:
```bash
cd Applications
```
```bash
cd FocusPro
```
```bash
cd Contents
```
```bash
cd Resources
```
```bash
open .
```
↳ or open the files with an editor like vim or nano
