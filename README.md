# 📝 Data Format<br>
tasks.txt -> a file to store current tasks that need to be done<br>
done.txt -> a file to store completed tasks<br>

- The tasks are intentionally stored in text files rather than binary, for easier manipulation outside of the application (sacrifising some speed for ease of use)

## 👉 Accessing the files
- tasks.txt is accessed within the application, but can also be found in `Documents > FocusPro` on Windows, and on MacOS:
